# Brand Exploration with an Agent

Built collaboratively in [this Amp thread](https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bc934-4227-71e8-adfa-ef16a6e6542e).

This project demonstrates a design system and component library created collaboratively with an AI agent. The brand—**Latent Intent**—explores a visual language that blends 70s terminal aesthetics with warm Scandinavian design principles. Using a cream background, verdant greens, rich golds, and a pairing of Work Sans (body) with Fira Mono (headings/accents), we built out a full typography scale, interactive components (buttons, links, forms, alerts), layout patterns (cards, tables, callouts), and geometric textures. The result is two HTML pages: a design system reference and a layouts showcase demonstrating real-world applications like hero sections, pricing tables, blog posts, and documentation.
